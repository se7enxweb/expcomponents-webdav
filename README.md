# expcomponents-webdav

This component allows you to set up and run your own WebDAV (RFC 2518) server, to enable online content editing for the users of your system through the WebDAV HTTP extension.

This is the Exponential fork of [zetacomponents/Webdav](https://github.com/zetacomponents/Webdav),
maintained by 7x (se7en.x) and the Exponential Foundation for Exponential and anyone else
who uses the Zeta Components Webdav component on current PHP versions. All credit for the
component goes to the Zeta Components authors listed in `composer.json` and `CREDITS`;
the upstream copyright notices (`NOTICE`) and the Apache License 2.0 (`LICENSE.txt`)
are kept unchanged.

## What is different from upstream

- The package is `se7enxweb/expcomponents-webdav` and replaces `zetacomponents/webdav`,
  so a project that requires the upstream package gets this one in its place.
- It requires the Exponential forks of the components it builds on (`se7enxweb/expcomponents-base`),
  which replace their upstream packages in the same way.
- The class names (`ezc*`) and the API are unchanged.
- Changes made in this fork are listed in `ChangeLog`.

## Installation

```bash
composer require se7enxweb/expcomponents-webdav
```

## Tests

```bash
composer update
vendor/bin/phpunit
```

The suite runs on every push for PHP 7.4, 8.0, 8.1, 8.2, 8.3, 8.4 and 8.5.
